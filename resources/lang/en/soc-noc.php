The SOC team may include other specialists, depending on the size of the organization or the industry in which it operates. Larger companies may include an Incident Response Director, responsible for communicating and coordinating the response to incidents. Some SOCs also include forensic investigators, who specialize in recovering data (evidence) from devices damaged or compromised during a cybersecurity incident.',
